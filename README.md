## Hosting Your Own Version

DWYN is simple to host yourself. Just download the repository and, using `pip`, manually install the dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt`. You can then open `bot.py` in your chosen text editor (e.g., VSCode) and run `bot.py`. It will error out about a token. To fix this, go to `.env` and replace `[REDACTED FOR SECURITY]` with *YOUR* generated bot token. 

**Important:** When pushing to GitHub, you *MUST* remove this bot token. Failure to do so will result in your removal from the project.
